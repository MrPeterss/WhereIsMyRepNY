# Where Is My Rep? | NY

WhereIsMyRepNY is a Next-JS project hosted using Vercel that shows new yorkers where their representatives offices are.

You can visit the compiled project

### Why?

There is too little access to a centralized location where all information about state representatives offices are located. This application serves to solve that issue.
