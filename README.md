# Where Is My Rep? | NY

WhereIsMyRepNY is a Next-JS project hosted using Vercel that shows New Yorkers where their state representatives offices are. Made for the NYS Department of Labor

You can visit the compiled project
[here](https://whereismyrepny.vercel.app) or by going to: [https://whereismyrepny.vercel.app](https://whereismyrepny.vercel.app)

### Why?

There is too little access to a centralized location where all information about state representatives offices are located. This application serves to solve that issue.
